Course Description

This course aimed to teach students the fundamental concepts, techniques, and methods of big data processing, as well as various architectures and platforms for big data processing. The course also covered the use of Python programming language for interactive programs, including the use of its appropriate linguistic features and external libraries, APIs, etc. Additionally, the course covered mathematical and statistical foundations needed for data mining and machine learning. The course also required students to complete a project and report that reflected on their critical awareness of methodological choices and written skills to accepted academic standards.

Project Description

During our previous exercises and assignments, we wished for an efficient verification tool for matrix calculations. We, therefore, decided to build one ourselves: We developed a user-friendly programme that enables students to check their calculations.
Our program can perform the following calculations for any matrices:

• multiplication of two matrices

• addition of two matrices

• subtraction of two matrices

• calculation of a matrix inverse

• calculation of a matrix determinant and

• calculation of a matrix eigenvalue and eigenvector.

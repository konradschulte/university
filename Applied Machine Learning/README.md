Course Description

The course aimed to teach students a clear understanding of the mathematical concepts behind machine-learning algorithms and the ability to explain it to non-technical business audience. Students were also taught to critically evaluate various cloud platform capabilities and services and recommend their applicability for a given business area, exhibit how to improve profit or optimize costs through machine learning in a logical and non-technical manner to the business audience, demonstrate excellent presentation skills in data storytelling and advise on how algorithms work, show the scaling of the algorithms on a cloud platform such as AWS/Azure and summarize and conceptualize fundamental machine learning concepts, methods and applications.

Project Description

The students were given a project to work on for a fictional company called XYZ, a leading manufacturing company with a global presence in 30 countries, a revenue of 25 Billion USD, and 40,000 employees. The company had experienced two-digit growth for the last four years. The project task was to classify the seven different stains in the company's production using a dataset of steel plates' faults. Currently, the dataset is residing in on-prem data sources SAP and Oracle. Company XYZ wants a scalable cloud solution where the data can be migrated to Azure Cloud using its appropriate services such that the solution can be made available for all their departments. The business justification is that by improving the classification and applying scalable Azure services, they can significantly improve the process and hence improve the bottom line by 15%.
